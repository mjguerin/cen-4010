**Finished all 4 functionalities of the 'Book Rating and Commenting' feature:**

1. Create a rating for a book by a user on a 5-star scale with a datestamp.  
2. Create a comment for a book by a user with a datestamp.  
3. Retrieve a list of all comments for a particular book.  
4. Retrieve the average rating for a book.  

This feature uses a generated user_Id for each user and a book's ISBN to fulfill all tasks. The userId is generated by the `Users` table. E.g., userId 1 is linked to 'john_doe' if using the dummy data provided.
